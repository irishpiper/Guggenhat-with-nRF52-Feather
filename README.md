# Guggenhat-with-nRF52-Feather
My continued attempt at modifying the Guggenhat code for use with an Adafruit nRF52 Bluefruit Feather

With little coding experience.... this took a long time.  The biggest hurdle was figuring out that nRF52 operates entirely different than the prevous BLE funcationality of the original code.  While in theory this makes it much easier.... when you only have a loose grip on what each line of code is doing - ferreting out the changes was complex.

In the end.  It is up and running.  I could use advice to clean it up and maybe make more efficient... but for anyone else who was struggling... this may be a good place to start.
