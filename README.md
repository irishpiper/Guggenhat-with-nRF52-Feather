# Guggenhat-with-nRF52-Feather
My continued attempt at modifying the Guggenhat code for use with an Adafruit nRF52 Bluefruit Feather

I have not been successful thusfar.  My coding is rudimentary at best.  I utilized what I could from Adafruits exaples regarding hte nRF52
feather (Bluefruit Feather).  However, at present I cannot seem to connect with their IOS app to try and send texts to the feather.

I am sure there is plenty wrong here - But I am told for most people it is simpe code - so any help would be appreciated.

The merge was the orginal Guggenhat code (updated with eye candy) with the Uart example code from Adafruid regarding the nRF52 

I have a feeling it is an issue with getting the Uart pairing in the correct portion of hte loop code so it has an actual chance to pair
before moving on.
